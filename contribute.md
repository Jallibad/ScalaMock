## Ways to contribute

Hey, great you are considering to contribute to ScalaMock!

Good News!
All source code is also publicly accessible on GitHub [github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock](https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock)


Another good place to start is the [list of open issues](https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp%20wanted) (bugs, feature requests, ...)

Or, if working with the source code is not for you, why not help out on stackoverflow, and help people there? Have a look at the [tagged questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scalamock)!
