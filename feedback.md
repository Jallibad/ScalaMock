## Reporting Bugs

ScalaMock bugs can be submitted to our [issues page](https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/issues) on github.
Please note that this is not the right place to ask for help or general questions about how to use ScalaMock.

## Finding Help

You can ask questions and seek help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scalamock?sort=newest) with the `scalamock` tag.

## Gitter Chat

While ScalaMock does not have its own chat channel, it is worth asking in the official [Gitter Scala channel](https://gitter.im/scala/scala) which is well attended and pretty helpful.
